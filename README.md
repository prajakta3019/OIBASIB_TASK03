Additional Notes
In this project, I performed an in-depth analysis of unemployment rates using Python as part of the data science internship at Oasis Infobyte. I explored various visualizations to understand the trends and patterns in unemployment data. The project includes descriptive statistics, heatmaps, box plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and geographical plots to gain insights into the impact of lockdown on employment.
